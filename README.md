# Park Up

This is the Github repository for the parking social impact build team

## Inspiration

Our app was inspired by the lack of available parking in West Campus at UT and the struggle to find parking spaces when they are needed the most. While there are public and campus parking garages, many of them are located in inconvient locations or do not offer long term parking solutions. We recognized this problem near our own campus and realized that many other college campuses likely face the same struggle. We also noticed that many parking spaces, like those rented by students living in apartments or condos, remain unused sometimes. We wanted to create a product that could solve this parking crisis by making unused non-public parking available to book for short or long term periods.

## What It Does

Park Up is a mobile app that addresses the parking crisis by making unused parking spaces available to rent for those are seeking short or long term parking. Park Up allows users to book available parking spaces or rent out their parking space when it is unused. Users who own a parking spot but want to earn a little income when it is not being used can put up their parking spot to be rented by others. Then, users in the area seeking for a parking spot can search for available parking spots and book them for a day or longer. Park Up works closely with apartments and condos to provide an incentive for them to allow students to rent out their spots.

## How We Built It

Our team primarily used React Native for our product. Our front end was built using React Native and Expo so it could be used on both IOS and Android phones. Our backend was built using Firebase since it was fairly easy to set up and use. We used Cloud Firestore to house all of our data and plan to use Firebase Authentication to authenticate users. 

## Challenges

For most of us on the team, this was our first time building a mobile app. Even though some of us had previous experience, there was a large learning curve at the start. We spent a lot of time learning JavaScript and working with React Native throughout the project. However, we were able to overcome this hurdle and produce a high quality mobile app. 

## What's Next

Our next steps for Park Up is provide greater security and authentication so users feel safe using our app. We plan to set up user autentication on our platform using Firebase Authentication. For parking spaces, we want to provide greater security by verifying parking spots when they are put out by users. We plan to implement a structure similar to Airbnb's by making users provide a selfie with their parking spot, as well as some additional documentation, like leasing information. We also plan to implement secure payment as well as a refund system in case users cancel or discover that the parking spot they booked is occupied.
